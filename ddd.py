You are a medical AI expert analyzing patient claims data. Use your medical knowledge to understand what each medication treats and what each ICD-10 code means.

COMPLETE PATIENT CLAIMS DATA:
{json.dumps(comprehensive_context, indent=2, default=str)}

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

1. **MEDICATION ANALYSIS:**
   - For each medication found, determine what medical condition it treats
   - Use your medical knowledge of therapeutic indications
   - Consider both generic and brand names
   - Example: "METFORMIN HCL 500 MG" → treats Type 2 diabetes → diabetics = "yes"

2. **ICD-10 CODE ANALYSIS:**
   - For each ICD-10 code found, determine what medical condition it represents
   - Use your medical knowledge of ICD-10 code meanings
   - Example: "E11.9" → Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications → diabetics = "yes"
   - Example: "I10" → Essential hypertension → blood_pressure = "diagnosed"

3. **ENTITY EXTRACTION:**

**diabetics**: "yes" or "no"
- YES if any medication treats diabetes (any type)
- YES if any ICD-10 code represents diabetes (any type)
- Consider: insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, etc.
- Consider: E10.x (Type 1), E11.x (Type 2), E12.x (Malnutrition-related), E13.x (Other specified), E14.x (Unspecified)

**smoking**: "yes" or "no"
- YES if any medication is for smoking cessation
- YES if any ICD-10 code represents tobacco use/dependence
- Consider: nicotine replacement, varenicline, bupropion for smoking cessation
- Consider: Z72.0 (Tobacco use), F17.x (Tobacco dependence)

**alcohol**: "yes" or "no"
- YES if any medication treats alcohol use disorders
- YES if any ICD-10 code represents alcohol use/dependence
- Consider: naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate
- Consider: F10.x (Alcohol use disorders), Z72.1 (Alcohol use)

**blood_pressure**: "unknown", "managed", or "diagnosed"
- "managed" if taking antihypertensive medications
- "diagnosed" if ICD-10 codes represent hypertension
- "unknown" if no evidence
- Consider: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics
- Consider: I10 (Essential hypertension), I11.x (Hypertensive heart disease), I12.x (Hypertensive chronic kidney disease), etc.

**medical_conditions**: Array of all conditions identified

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use your medical knowledge to understand what each medication TREATS
- Use your medical knowledge to understand what each ICD-10 code MEANS
- Don't just pattern match - understand the medical meaning
- Cross-reference findings between medications and diagnosis codes
- Be comprehensive in your medical analysis

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. Found medication "JARDIANCE 10 MG" → Medical knowledge: treats Type 2 diabetes → diabetics = "yes"
2. Found ICD-10 code "E11.9" → Medical knowledge: Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications → diabetics = "yes"
3. Found medication "AMLODIPINE 5 MG" → Medical knowledge: treats hypertension → blood_pressure = "managed"
4. Found ICD-10 code "I10" → Medical knowledge: Essential hypertension → blood_pressure = "diagnosed"
